#
# name:      volume name. it can't include the ':' character and is limited
#            to 27 characters in length.
#
# variable substitutions:
# you can use variables for both <path> and <name> now. here are the
# rules:
#     1) if you specify an unknown variable, it will not get converted.
#     2) if you specify a known variable, but that variable doesn't have
#        a value, it will get ignored.
#
# the variables:
# $b   -> basename of path
# $c   -> client's ip or appletalk address
# $d   -> volume pathname on server
# $f   -> full name (whatever's in the gecos field)
# $g   -> group
# $h   -> hostname
# $i   -> client ip without tcp port or appletalk network
# $s   -> server name (can be the hostname)
# $u   -> username (if guest, it's whatever user guest is running as)
# $v   -> volume name (either ADEID_NAME or basename of path)
# $z   -> zone (may not exist)
# $$   -> $
#
# casefold options [syntax: casefold:option]:
# tolower    -> lowercases names in both directions

# xlatelower -> client sees lowercase, server sees uppercase
# xlateupper -> client sees uppercase, server sees lowercase
#
# allow/deny/rwlist/rolist format [syntax: allow:user1,@group]:
# user1,@group,user2  -> allows/denies access from listed users/groups
#                        rwlist/rolist control whether or not the
#			 volume is ro for those users.
# preexec             -> command to be run when the volume is mounted,
#                        ignore for user defined volumes
# root_preexec        -> command to be run as root when the volume is mounted,

#
# codepage options [syntax: options:charsetname]
# volcharset           -> specifies the charset to be used as the volume codepage

# ro                  -> mount the volume as read-only.
# mswindows           -> enforce filename restrictions imposed by MS

# nohex		      -> don't do :hex translations for anything
#		         except dot files. specify usedots as well if
#			 you want that turned off. note: this option
#			 makes the / character illegal.
# usedots             -> don't do :hex translation for dot files. note: when
#                        this option gets set, certain file names
#			 become illegal. these are .Parent and

# preexec_close       -> a non-zero return code from preexec close the
#                        volume being mounted.
